CarShare mobile application allows its users to share their car with other people who are travelling to the same destination and are located nearby.  There are two types of users one who is driving a car and the other who is looking for a lift.  Once the application is installed in a device, the application allows the user to register by providing their basic details.  At the registration stage user is required to provide their name and contact number and create a username and password.  Once registered and signed in the application detects user’s current location through devices location services and user is allowed to choose their desired destination by touching on a map which leaves a marker on that location being touched. The marker can be dragged if the location being touched is not precise.  A destination can be saved for later use.  Once the user’s current location and destination has been determined they can search for other users.  A list of user’s is displayed which is compiled based on the user’s current location, their chosen destination and whether they are driving or not.  User can call or send an SMS directly from the app to any other user who is displayed in the list.
